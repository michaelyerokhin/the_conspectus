# 💡 The Conspectus

_A civic knowledge platform for structured, transparent profiles of influential figures._

---

### 📄 Description

The Conspectus is a civic knowledge platform that creates structured, transparent profiles of influential figures to place them in context with each other, the world, and the reader.  

Each profile is:
- Built using AI from trusted journalistic sources  
- Refined by human editors  
- Mapped onto a worldview model showing where the figure stands on key global issues and values  

Users can also take a quiz to map their own worldview on the same axes and compare their alignment to any profiled figure.  

**Long-term goal:** Become a go-to resource for clear, trustworthy context about people shaping the world, while using collected data to build elevated, high-value intelligence.

### 🛠️ Part 1: Core Platform Rebuild (Expected: October 14)
**Key Tasks:**
- Audit current stack (Supabase + Lovable + OpenAI API + GitHub) → Migrate to **Supabase + Typescript + Next.js + OpenAI Prompting**  
- Stand up backend on Supabase with clean schema (focus: storing users; structure later)  
- Build API layer for reading/writing data  
- Implement basic user authentication  
- Define backend roles: administrator, editor, viewer (default)  
- Deploy on reliable hosting (Vercel)  

---

### 🔀 Part 2: Data Ingestion & Processing Pipeline (Expected: November 7)
**Key Tasks:**
- Prototype ingestion from trusted sources  
- Normalize into structured fields (leader, stance, issue, timestamp)  
- Run a first-pass LLM workflow for tagging/profiling (quote vs policy stance vs bio fact)  

---

### 🏁 Part 3: Feature Reconstruction (Expected: Dec 3)
**Key Tasks:**
- **Profiles:** Structured leader pages (bio, positions, metadata, sources)  
- **Situation Rooms:** Time-stamped, hyper-dynamic event feeds  
- **Trending Topics:** Automatically surface leaders/issues based on content activity  

---

### 🔑 Project Details

- **Frontend:** Typescript, Next.js  
- **Backend:** Typescript, Node.js  
- **Database:** Supabase 
- **Testing:** Cypress, Jest
- **Build:** Turbo

# 💯 Best Practices / PR Etiquette

### Creating a PR
If you’re working on an issue, create a branch from the issue page (open it locally). In your terminal:
```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git checkout -b branch-name
```

### Testing  
📝 Testing! Reference Testing section below before continuing here!

### Final Steps
⚠️ Safety first! Put all credentials into `.env` file and use them from there. Make sure `.env` is in the `.gitignore` so that it is not visible in the remote.

### Committing
Finally, type `npx cz` in your terminal, which will prompt you to declare the details of your PR (**NEVER PUSH DIRECTLY TO MAIN**). Make sure to then sync changes in source control or by running `git push` to push remotely.

**You should always request someone to review your PR before it is merged.**



 

# 🦺 Testing!
We will be using **Cypress** and **Jest** for testing the frontend/backend, respectively. For the most part, we will be writing our tests with Jest as this project is heavily backend based: Don't worry too much about Cypress for now :) 

After you have finished making changes on the backend, you should write Jest tests within `apps/backend/src/tests` (very rudimentary example found in `example.test.ts`)
**Your tests should ensure accuracy by mocking the behavior your feature aims to accomplish.**
- **Resources on Jest: https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started**




# 🧠 Useful Commands
- **Booting up: `git pull && npm run build`**
- **Testing: `cd <directory> && npm run test`**
- **Committing: `git add` (either `.` for everything or type the files you want to add to your commit) `&& npx cz`** 
- **Updating: `npm install && npm run build`**
- **Everything sucks: `close editor and go for a walk`**
